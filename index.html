		<h2>"Wolverine AKA Logan"</h2>

		<p>
			Wolverine (born James Howlett[2] commonly known as Logan and sometimes as Weapon X) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, mostly in association with the X-Men. He is a mutant who possesses animal-keen senses, enhanced physical capabilities, powerful regenerative ability known as a healing factor, and three retractable bone claws in each hand. Wolverine has been depicted variously as a member of the X-Men, Alpha Flight, and the Avengers.
 			"I'm the best there is at what I do, but what I do best isn't very nice."
			Wolverine is typical of the many tough antiheroes that emerged in American popular culture after the Vietnam War;[3] his willingness to use deadly force and his brooding nature became standard characteristics for comic book antiheroes by the end of the 1980s.[4] As a result, the character became a fan favorite of the increasingly popular X-Men franchise,[5] and has been featured in his own solo comic since 1988.</p>

		<h2>"Spider-man AKA Peter Parker"</h2>

		<p>
		Spider-Man is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko, and first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. Lee and Ditko conceived the character as an orphan being raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker were killed in a plane crash, and as a teenager, having to deal with the normal struggles of adolescence in addition to those of a costumed crime-fighter. Spider-Man's creators gave him super strength and agility, the ability to cling to most surfaces, shoot spider-webs using wrist-mounted devices of his own invention, which he calls "web-shooters", and react to danger quickly with his "spider-sense", enabling him to combat his foes.</p>

		<h2>Magneto AKA Max Eisenhardt</h2>

		
		<p>
			The character is a powerful mutant, one of a fictional subspecies of humanity born with superhuman abilities, who has the ability to generate and control magnetic fields. Magneto regards mutants as evolutionarily superior to humans and rejects the possibility of peaceful human-mutant coexistence; he aims to conquer the world to enable mutants, whom he refers to as homo superior, to replace humans as the dominant species. Writers have since fleshed out his origins and motivations, revealing him to be a Holocaust survivor whose extreme methods and cynical philosophy derive from his determination to protect mutants from suffering a similar fate at the hands of a world that fears and persecutes mutants. He is a friend of Charles Xavier, the leader of the X-Men, but their different philosophies cause a rift in their friendship at times. Magneto's role in comics has varied from supervillain to antihero to superhero, having served as an occasional ally and even a member of the X-Men at times.
			His character's early history has been compared with the civil rights leader Malcolm X[8][9] and Jewish Defense League founder Meir Kahane.[10][11] Magneto opposes the pacifist attitude of Professor X and pushes for a more aggressive approach to achieving civil rights. In 2011, IGN's ranked Magneto as the Greatest Comic Book Villian of All Time.</p>
